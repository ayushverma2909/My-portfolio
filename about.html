      Hi, I'm Ayush Verma, a passionate and enthusiastic fresher software developer with a solid foundation in C, C++, JavaScript, and basic Python. I have a keen interset in problem-solving and software development. Throughout my learning journey, I've gained expertise in Data Structures, Algorithms(DSA), and Object-Oriented programming (OOP). I've applied these skills in various projects, such as building a Myntra Clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and creating a KBC quiz game with c and many more. <br><br>
      Additionally, I developed a Library Management System in C++, showcasing my understanding of OOP concepts. I am eager to further enhance my skills and take few challenges. My passion for learning and growing in the field of sorftware development motivates me to contribute effectively to innovative projects, and I look forward to applying my knowledge in a professional environment.
